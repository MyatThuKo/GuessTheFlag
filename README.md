<h1> Guess The Flag </h1>
<p>
This is the second project from 100 Days of SwiftUI (Day 20, 21, 22). https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui
<br>
Things I learned from this project are
<ol> 
<li> Stacks 
  <ol>
    <li> HStack - Horizontal Stacks </li>
    <li> VStack - Verizontal Stacks </li>
    <li> ZStack - Stack arranged by depth</li> 
  </ol>
</li>
<li> Colors and frames </li>
<li> Gradients such as 
  <ol>
    <li> LinearGradient </li>
    <li> RadialGradient </li>
    <li> AngularGradient aka conic or conical gradient </li> 
  </ol>
</li>
<li> Buttons and images </li>
<li> Showing alert messages </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
At the end of day 22, part 3 of the project, there is a challenge to create. They are as following. 

<ol> 
  <li>Add an @State property to store the user’s score, modify it when they get an answer right or wrong, then display it in the alert. </li>
  <li>Show the player’s current score in a label directly below the flags. </li>
  <li> When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message – something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France,” for example.</li>
</ol>

For the challenge #2, I decided to show the result above the flags, under the title of the app. 
The experience is really great. 
</p>

<p> On Day 24, the challenge is to come back to this project 2 to add a set of modifiers to display the Flag Images.
